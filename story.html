    <h1>Mad Libs</h1>
    <h3>Story Time!</h3>
    <div class="content">
        <p>{{ context.proper_noun1 }}'s next band of {{ context.noun1 }} faired a little better. {{ context.proper_noun2 }} and {{ context.proper_noun3 }} were her buddies for about five years, give or take. The {{ context.noun2 }}, Constantine, had remarried and forgiven {{ context.proper_noun1 }}. In time, she became like an older sister to her, gave her a {{ context.noun3 }} at her adventurer supply store, even made {{ context.proper_noun1 }} custom {{ context.noun4 }}. {{ context.proper_noun2 }} and {{ context.proper_noun3 }} were old pros but lacked in one regard. {{ context.proper_noun2 }} was an archer, one of the best, but he was weird and off putting. {{ context.proper_noun1 }} didn't know if he was a cannibal or a zombie, but she did know from the way he looked at her that he wanted to eat her {{ context.noun5 }}. {{ context.proper_noun3 }} was an Elven mage. Turned out not to be his actual name. No one could properly pronounce the Elven name so the town just started calling him “Green's Man.” The moniker stuck to him. He rolled with the punches and gave up on correcting people. But every adventuring band needs muscle. They needed a {{ context.adj1 }} {{ context.adj2 }} brute to {{ context.verb1 }} a sword like a lunatic. They needed {{ context.proper_noun1 }}. So, they pitched it and thus it began.</p>
        <p>Their first quest went down without a hitch. A bridge ogre {{ context.verb2 }} like a piece of cake. {{ context.proper_noun1 }} would tell how all the townsfolk fawned over her, practically stripping her while unwrapping all the ogre entrails she had gotten covered in. What {{ context.proper_noun1 }} always forgets to mention is that she was married at the time and her husband was watching, grinding his teeth into a {{ context.adj3 }} powder as she flirted with everyone in sight. Luckily the former {{ context.noun1 }} and newly married Misses {{ context.proper_noun2 }} gave her a room after {{ context.proper_noun1 }}'s husband {{ context.verb3 }} her to the curve. Soon after the trio were {{ context.noun4 }}. {{ context.proper_noun3 }} managed to keep getting them gigs and make the books even out. No one knew how, so “Elven {{ context.noun6 }}” was what got the credit for the profits.</p>
