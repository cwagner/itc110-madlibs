Molly's next band of adventures faired a little better. Thaddeus and Greensemen were her buddies for about five years, give or take. The widow, Constantine, had remarried and forgiven Molly. In time, she became like an older sister to her, gave her a job at her adventurer supply store, even made Molly custom armor. Thaddeus and Greensemen were old pros but lacked in one regard. Thaddeus was an archer, one of the best, but he was weird and off putting. Molly didn't know if he was a cannibal or a zombie, but she did know from the way he looked at her that he wanted to eat her brains. Greensemen was an Elven mage. Turned out not to be his actual name. No one could properly pronounce the Elven name so the town just started calling him “Green's Man.” The moniker stuck to him. He rolled with the punches and gave up on correcting people. But every adventuring band needs muscle. They needed a big hulking brute to swing a sword like a lunatic. They needed Molly. So, they pitched it and thus it began.

 

Their first quest went down without a hitch. A bridge ogre slayed like a piece of cake. Molly would tell how all the townsfolk fawned over her, practically stripping her while unwrapping all the ogre entrails she had gotten covered in. What Molly always forgets to mention is that she was married at the time and her husband was watching, grinding his teeth into a fine powder as she flirted with everyone in sight. Luckily the former widow and newly married Misses Thaddeus gave her a room after Molly's husband kicked her to the curve. Soon after the trio were racking up. Greensemen managed to keep getting them gigs and make the books even out. No one knew how, so “Elven Magic” was what got the credit for the profits.
